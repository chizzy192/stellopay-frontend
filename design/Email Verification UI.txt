Email Verification & Onboarding Screen

Product: StelloPay
Role: UI/UX Designer
Platform: Web
Focus: Clean onboarding · Trust · Clarity

Overview

I designed a clean and modern email verification screen as part of StelloPay’s onboarding flow. The goal was to create a frictionless experience that reassures users while guiding them clearly through email confirmation.

Design Goals

Reduce onboarding friction

Communicate trust and security

Keep the interface minimal and friendly

Clearly guide users through verification

Design Approach

The layout is split into two clear sections:

Left panel: A visually engaging brand section that highlights community growth and creates emotional connection.

Right panel: A focused verification flow with minimal distractions, ensuring users complete the task quickly.

A soft purple color palette was used to maintain brand consistency while conveying reliability and calmness. Generous spacing, rounded elements, and subtle iconography enhance clarity and accessibility.

Key UI Decisions

OTP input design: Circular input fields improve readability and reduce input errors

Microcopy: Friendly, reassuring language to reduce user anxiety

Visual feedback: Notification icon reinforces successful email delivery

Clear CTAs: “Verify Mail” stands out as the primary action

Accessibility: High contrast text and simple layout improve usability
