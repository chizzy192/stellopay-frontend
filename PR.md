# Pull Request: Footer Redesign

## Description

This PR introduces a comprehensive redesign of the footer component to match the new design specifications. The footer has been transformed from a minimal navigation bar into a full-featured, modern footer with multiple sections.

### Changes Made:

- **Logo & Brand Section**: Added StelloPay logo (using `stellopay-icon.svg` from public folder) with brand name and company description
- **Navigation Columns**: Implemented 4 organized link columns:
  - **Product**: Features, Pricing, Security, API, Integrations
  - **Company**: About, Blog, Careers, Press, Partners
  - **Resources**: Documentation, Help Center, Tutorials, Community, Error Pages
  - **Legal**: Privacy, Terms, Cookie Policy, Licenses
- **Social Media Links**: Added circular icon buttons for Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Email with hover effects
- **Newsletter Subscription**: Centered section with:
  - Heading: "Stay updated with StelloPay"
  - Description text
  - Email input field with validation
  - Subscribe button with loading state
- **Bottom Bar**: Copyright notice and legal links (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Cookie Policy)

### Technical Improvements:

- Fully responsive grid layout (mobile-first with breakpoints for md and lg screens)
- Smooth hover transitions on all interactive elements
- Purple accent color (`#7C3AED`) for brand consistency
- Custom SVG icon components for social media
- Form handling with loading state for newsletter subscription
